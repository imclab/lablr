lablr is a simple app that creates test shipping labels using EasyPost's api.

To run:

1. Confirm you have python 2.7 installed.

2. Confirm you have 'virtual_env' installed or get it here https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv.

3. Create a python virtual environment in a folder you have permissions to by running 'virtualenv USE_YOUR_ENV_NAME'.

4. Activate your virtual environment by running 'cd USE_YOUR_ENV_NAME', then 'source bin/activate'.

5. Go to the root folder of lablr and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt', this will install all dependencies.

6. Now run 'python run.py', this will run the Flask app.

7. Open up a browser, preferably chrome and navigate to 'http://localhost:5000' and create a label!
